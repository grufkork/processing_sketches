[The finished animation](https://imgur.com/a/aDG5WKB)

A stylised ( <- an artsy word that sounds better than "I couldn't be bothered to look up metaballs") version of [this post on /r/LoadingIcons](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoadingIcons/comments/hgmfmb/this_would_make_a_great_loading_icon/) that I made after a lot of people expected me to do. Probably not quite what you people expected, but I imagine this one as a small looping icon in the bottom corner of a game loading screen. 

The code is an absolute mess with layers of nested `pow()`:s and `1/x`:es and it's a galactically far cry from neat. I'm not quite sure what everything is as it's been *lots* of trial and error because I couldn't be bothered to stop a moment and think either. If something looks complicated, it's probably just some magic numbers and transformations to make curves and stuff feel nice. Ah yes, the magic numbers. They're hard-coded and uncommented, good luck figuring out what they do.

Anyways, not my proudest work but I won't spend much more time on this... Hope you like it regardless :)
